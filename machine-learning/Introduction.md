# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Data - General Perspective
* Standard data terminology used in general when talking about spreadsheets of data
* Data terminology used in statistics and statistical view of machine learning
* Data terminology used in computer science perspective of machine learning
### Tabular Data
Commonly used data format
#### Column
A column describes data of a single type. All data in one column will have the same scale and meaning relative to each other.
For example: weights, heights, prices etc...
#### Row
A row describles a single entity or observation and the columns describe properties about that entity or observation.
#### Cell
A cell is a single value in a row and column. It may be a real value or a category.
## Data - Statistical Learning Perspective
The statistical perspective frames data in the context of a hypothetical function (f) that the machine learning algorithm is trying to learn. That is, given some input variables (input), what is the predicted output variable (output).
