# Front End Workflow
_(Reference: https://automateyourworkflow.com/)_
The six phases of front end development workflow
> 1. Scaffolding
> 2. Development
> 3. Testing
> 4. Integration
> 5. Optimisation
> 6. Deployment

## Scaffolding
In this phase you prepare the development environment by creating git repository,
create the necessary files and folders, download the necessary libraries, setup servers and databases.
1. Create Git Repositories
2. Download the dependencies
3. Create the folders and files
4. Add javascript files
5. Add css files
6. Create Databases
7. Prepare Servers
## Development
This is the main phase of the workflow where the coding is done. Automation in this phase involves the following steps:
1. Reducing the number of keystrokes and clicks 2. Writing less code
3. Writing code that’s easier to understand
4. Speeding up the installation of libraries
5. Speeding up the debugging process
6. Switch between development and production environments quickly
## Testing
In this phase you check for the following items:
1. check if your code works
2. check if your code is formatted properly
3. check if the code you’ve just written breaks anything else on your
site.
## Integration
## Optimisation
## Deployment
