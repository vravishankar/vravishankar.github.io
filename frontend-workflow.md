# Front End Workflow
_(Reference: https://automateyourworkflow.com/)_
The six phases of front end development workflow
> 1. Scaffolding
> 2. Development
> 3. Testing
> 4. Integration
> 5. Optimisation
> 6. Deployment

## Scaffolding
In this phase you prepare the development environment by creating git repository,
create the necessary files and folders, download the necessary libraries, setup servers and databases.
1. Create Git Repositories
2. Download the dependencies
3. Create the folders and files
4. Add javascript files
5. Add css files
6. Create Databases
7. Prepare Servers
## Development
This is the main phase of the workflow where the coding is done. Automation in this phase involves the following steps:
1. Reducing the number of keystrokes and clicks 2. Writing less code
3. Writing code that’s easier to understand
4. Speeding up the installation of libraries
5. Speeding up the debugging process
6. Switch between development and production environments quickly
## Testing
In this phase you check for the following items:
1. check if your code works
2. check if your code is formatted properly
3. check if the code you’ve just written breaks anything else on your
site.
## Integration
Code from different developers are merged in this phase. This usually involves pushing repos and merging git branches together. The nightly builds and continuous integration are part of this phase.
1. Nightly Builds
2. Continuous Integration
## Optimisation
In this phase the main work is to optimise the code, style sheets, images so that the web page is loaded faster. The code and stylesheets sizes needs to be as small as possible for the pages to be loaded at the quickest possible time. 
1. Minifying CSS
2. Minifying and concatenating JavaScript 
3. Combining multiple images into a sprite 
4. Optimizing images and other assets
5. Cachebusting assets
## Deployment
This is the final phase of the workflow. Automation of this phase involves deploying the code to the production servers, cloud services like AWS, Digital Ocean or Heroku.
